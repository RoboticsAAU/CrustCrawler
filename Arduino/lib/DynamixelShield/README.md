# DynamixelShield [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelShield.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelShield)

DynamixelShield Library for Arduino

> This library inherits and uses [Dynamixel2Arduino library](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/Dynamixel2Arduino).
> Therefore, it must be installed.

> The reason for the distinction between DynamixelShield and Dynamixel2Arduino is that Dynamixel2Arduino is intended to be used on non-Shield hardware. The DynamixelShield library is DynamixelShield's dedicated library created by Dynamixel2Arduino.
